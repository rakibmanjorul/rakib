    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
      literature
      from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
      Virginia,
      looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
      cites of
      the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
      1.10.33
      of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
      treatise
      on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
      sit
      amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32
      and
      1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
      accompanied by
      English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
      denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give
      you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
      master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
      but
      because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
      Nor
      again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
      occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
      example,
      which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
      right
      to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a
      pain
      that produces no resultant pleasure.</p>
